I was born in Rome and obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics at Sapienza Universita di Roma (under the supervision of prof. E. Marinari and prof. F. Sciortino, respectively).
After my Master's degree, I obtained an 8-month Junior Research Fellowship with prof. Sciortino to investigate the structural properties of water under supercooled conditions (continuing the work of my Master's thesis).

In September 2021, I started my PhD studies at ETH Zurich, in the lab of prof. R. Stocker, in the field of microbial biophysics.
